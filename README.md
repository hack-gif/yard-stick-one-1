# yard-stick-one-1
Im very new on ubuntu and definetely on yard stick one, and I just need some help how to start up with my yard stick one. I stuck on sudo python setup.py install. and definetely on rfcat -r, which says that I have to flash a bootloader File "/usr/local/bin/rfcat", line 45     print "Protecting you from yourself.  If you want to trigger Bootloader mode (you will then *have* to flash a new RfCat image on it) use the --force argument as well"           ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
